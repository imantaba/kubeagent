# Failure diagnostics

`kubeagent` scans your cluster, finds unhealthy pods, and explains *why* they
are failing — covering the most common pod failure modes.

## Read-only operation

`kubeagent` talks to the cluster directly via the official Kubernetes Go client
(`client-go`) — the same library `kubectl` and operators use — and operates
**read-only**. It never creates, updates, patches, or deletes cluster resources.

## Failure modes detected

### CrashLoopBackOff

The container keeps restarting. Kubernetes backs off exponentially between
attempts. `kubeagent` surfaces the exit code and last termination reason so you
can spot crash loops without tailing logs manually.

### ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull

The image cannot be pulled — either the image tag does not exist or the node
lacks credentials for the registry. `kubeagent` reports the image reference and
the pull error from the pod's conditions.

### OOMKilled

The container exceeded its memory limit and was killed by the kernel OOM killer.
`kubeagent` annotates the finding with the container's configured requests and
limits (see [Resource context](resource-context.md)) so you can judge whether to
raise the limit or reduce memory pressure.

### Pending / Unschedulable

No node can place the pod. This covers insufficient CPU or memory, a missing
taint toleration, an unsatisfied node affinity, or no nodes at all.
`kubeagent` reports the scheduler message from the pod's events.

## Status

`kubeagent scan` performs a read-only, whole-cluster scan and reports
CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff/ErrImagePull, OOMKilled, and
Pending/Unschedulable pods, in text or JSON.

The optional `--explain` flag makes a single Claude API call to summarize
findings in plain English. The deterministic core still works offline with no
API key.
